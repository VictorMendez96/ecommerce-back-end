## Description
#### User Story 

AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies


#### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database


## Installation

This application is demonstrating the function of a back-end for e-commerce. Since this is not an application that is deployed you will need to copy the code to your local drive. After downloading the program you will use a terminal to go to the program folder and run the command below: 
```
npm i
```

This will install all dependencies. You will also need an API client to run CRUD API calls, like Insomnia.


## Usage

You will open your API Client and start making CRUD requests to the API. You should get results like the ones in the screenshots below or in the walk-through video also below.
